there is no Like operator in VBScript. You could use Instr.

if Instr( 1, strPrinter, "printer_USA", vbTextCompare ) > 0 then

The vbTextCompare constant ( value=1) is used to Perform a textual comparison

Like operator is case-sensitive, but Instr is not.

Pattens can be used with Like operator. See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/language/reference/user-interface-help/like-operator
