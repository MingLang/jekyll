Dim statements are not required unless the VBScript contains an Option Explicit statement.

Unlike many other languages there is no need to specify a data type (integer, string, object etc) All VBScript variables are variants. 
You can choose a variable name that indicates the data type to be stored e.g. strEmployee, but this is not enforced.
